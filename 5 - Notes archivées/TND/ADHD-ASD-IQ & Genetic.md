# ADHD/ASD/IQ & Genetic 

##### Datasets
 - [[TDAH|ADHD]] = 20k sujets, 35k contrôles. Processus Ricopili 
 - [[TSA|ASD]] = 18k sujets, 28k contrôles. Sous population d'une cohorte comprenant tous les enfants nés au Danemark entre 1981  & fin 2005.
 - [[intelligence]] = 269k sujets. Cumule de plusieurs cohortes.
 
 **_Results:_** Our results showed that intelligence has a positive and negative genetic correlation with [[TSA|ASD]] and [[TDAH|ADHD]], respectively, including three hub genomic regions showing correlated genetic effects across the three traits. Polygenic overlap analysis indicated that all the risk variants contributing to [[TDAH|ADHD]] are overlapped with half of those for intelligence, and the majority of the shared variants have opposite effect directions between them. The majority of risk variants (80%) of [[TSA|ASD]] are overlapped with almost all the risk variants of intelligence (97%). Notably, some [[TSA|ASD]]/intelligence overlapping variants displayed opposing effects on these two conditions. MR analysis showed that the genetic liability to higher intelligence was associated with an increased risk for [[TSA|ASD]] (OR = 1.12) and a decreased risk for [[TDAH|ADHD]] (OR = 0.78) (**masquage [[TDAH]] par [[capacités cognitives|capacité cognitive]] ++ ?**). Cross-trait meta-analyses identified 170 pleiotropic genomic loci across the three traits, including 12 novel loci. Functional analyses of the novel genes support their potential involvement in neurodevelopment.
  
 **_Conclusion:_** Our results suggest that [[TDAH|ADHD]] is associated with inheriting a reduced set of low-intelligence alleles, whereas [[TSA|ASD]] results from incongruous effects from a mixture of high-intelligence and low-intelligence contributing alleles summed up with additional, [[TSA|ASD]]-specific risk variants not associated with intelligence.
