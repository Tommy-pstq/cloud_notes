	- *Initialement : adhésion et différenciation cellulaire*
		- *Cancer* : retrouvé dans bcp de tumeurs humaines  
	- *CD24 may also be involved in adaptive
		immunity, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases and in the central nervous system
		(CNS).*
	-  *CD24 is an essential player in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis*
	- *polymorphism of CD24 is associated with increased risk of autoimmune diseases*	- *In the developing CNS, CD24 is expressed in developing postmitotic neurons and in*
		*growing axons , while in the adult brain, CD24 is also expressed in neurons in areas*
		*exhibiting neurogenesis as well as in microglia; CD24 involvement in neurogenesis*
		*may indicate its relevance to cognitive functions and neurodegeneration*

	- In adult mice, CD24 is involved in the development of the neuronal network. CD24
		expression is maintained in adulthood in secondary neurogenesis regions, such as in
		the hippocampus, and it can promote neurite outgrowth in cerebellar neurons and
		hippocampal neurons. 

	- Belvindrah et al. showed that adult mCD24−/− mutant mice exhibited increased neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus [36 ]
	- In order to exert its effect in cells, CD24 interacts with numerous associated pro-
		teins for signal transduction

- Objectif étude 
	- *. This study aims
		to characterize cognitive and emotional functions of CD24 knockout mice (CD24−/− )compared with CD24 wild-type mice at three time-points: adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood.*
- Méthode éval comportement 
	- *Open Field Test (OFT)—This test reflects the conflict between the innate fear that mice
		have of a novel open field’s central area versus their desire to explore new environments*
	- *Elevated plus-maze (EPM)—EPM is based on the natural tendency of mice to avoid*
		*open and elevated place*
	- *Y maze (YM)—The YM assay is based on the tendency of mice to explore a new
		environment*
	- *Novel Object recognition (OR)—OR utilizes the natural tendency of mice to explore
		novel stimuli*
	- *Forced swim test (FST)—The FST was used to monitor depression-like behavior*
	- *Tail suspension test (TST)—Mice behavioral despair was evaluated in the TST by
		measuring immobility*
	- *Morris water maze (MWM)—This classical spatial learning assay*

- Méthode vérif génétique 
	- *These CD24−/− KO mice are genetically tested regularly by PCR analysis of DNA obtained
		from tail biopsies at the age of 5 weeks. The expression of CD24 has also been verified
		by FACS analysis on heparinized peripheral blood samples collected from the orbital
		sinus of mice from the same cohorts that were not used for the behavioral test

- Résultats comportementaux 
	- *CD24−/− mice exhibited better cognitive performance and less anxiety-like
		behavior compared with WT mice, with no effect on depression-like behavior. This phenotype was
		constant from childhood (2 months old) to adulthood (6 months old)

- In the present study, we report, for the first time, the behavioral phenotype of CD24−/−
mice. CD24−/− mice exhibited better cognitive performance and less anxiety-like behavior compared with WT mice. This phenotype was constant from adolescence (2 months old)
up to mature adulthood (6 months of age).

- Our results contradict a recent report
showing that the pharmacological blockade of CD24 worsened the cognitive impairment
after traumatic brain injury [40]. 

- Importantly, it was suggested that CD24 might play a dual effect in neurogenesis in response to different neuronal and immunological situations [ 31 ]. These kinds of dual effects are not uncommon in the immune system [41 ], and it was suggested that this quality of the innate immune system might be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [42].
